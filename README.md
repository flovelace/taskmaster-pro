# Taskmaster Pro
This is a kanban style web application that allows users to organise their tasks. These can be work tasks or personal tasks. This kanban board was created as a free and simple to use alternative to other kanban boards out there! Users can set completion dates, move to each column using drag and drop, and delete tasks when finished. It also uses a date picker for easy date entry.
